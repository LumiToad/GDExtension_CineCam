### H_VirtualCam3D
> Inherits: Node3D < CanvasItem < Node < Object

#### Description

This help document refers to [VirtualCam3D] class! \
Virtual camera for the [H_CineCam3D]. \
Imagine these nodes as dummy cameras for the [H_CineCam3D]. \
\
These dummy cameras will automatically register to the first found [H_CineCam3D]. \
Be careful! At least one virtual camera has to be above a [H_CineCam3D] in the hierarchy! \
Otherwise the game will crash! \
You can setup blends, a camera priority and an ID to find a virtual camera node. \
See [H_CineCam3D] for all the things, that you can do with a [H_VirtualCam3D] node! \
\
They also contain all the properties of a [Camera3D] as dummy values without any use. \
Using [method H_CineCam3D.apply_vcam3d_data], you can copy the data to your currently runing [H_CineCam3D].

#### Signals
> * _signal_ priority_changed(vcam3d: Object, priority: int)()\
\
> Emitted, when the [member H_VirtualCam3D.priority] has changed




#### Property Description

> * _String_ <a id="vcam_id">vcam_id<a/> \
> [SET] set_vcam_id(value) \
> [GET] get_vcam_id() \
\
> Getter / Setter for the vcam_id property. \
> This [String] is just a name, which you can search, using [method H_CineCam3D.find_vcam_by_id]. \
 

> * _int=0_ <a id="priority">priority<a/> \
> [SET] set_priority(value) \
> [GET] get_priority() \
\
> Getter / Setter for the priority of this virtual camera. \
> A [H_CineCam3D] will always know the virtual camera with the highest priority. \
> See [enum H_CineCam3D.FollowMode] for this. \
> The [H_CineCam3D] will register the priority, either when: \
> - [H_VirtualCam3D] nodes are changed (instanced for example) in the scene tree. \
> - If their priority changes. \
> This also happens, when loading the scene! \
> If two or more virtual cameras have the same priority, a [H_CineCam3D] will register the latest registered as the new "highest priority virtual camera". \
 

> * _H_BlendData3D_ <a id="blend_data">blend_data<a/> \
> [SET] _set_blend_data(value) \
> [GET] _get_blend_data() \
\
> The default blending data for this virtual camera. \
> Will be used, when a [H_CineCam3D] blends to this virtual camera. \
> If this is empty, [member H_CineCam3D.blend_data] will be used as a default blend. \
