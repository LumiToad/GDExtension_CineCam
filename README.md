  <h1>CineCam GDExtension for Godot 4.2.2</h1>

  <p>
    This GDExtension was developed as part of my final thesis at the <a href="https://www.school4games.net">School For Games</a> in Berlin! <br />
    A Camera addon for Godot 4.2.2.<br />
    Loosely based on the Unity Cinemachine.<br /><br />
    Makes blending and shaking cameras easy!<br />
    Aimed to reduce the amount of code lines in your project a lot.<br />
    A lot can be configured in the Inspector. <br /> <br />

  <h2>Responsiblities</h2>
  - The entire gameplay programming -<br /><br />
  Including UI, Features, everything.<br />
  Since I started learning programming only a few month prior, I had some help from teachers.<br />
  But the implementation was still my responsibility.<br /><br />
  - Create tools, using Godot features -<br /><br />
  Created tools for level / game design, such as:<br />
    <li>Camera Control Zones</li>
    <li>Audio Control Zones</li>
    <li>Tutorial Control Zones</li>
    <li>Dialog Boxes</li>
    <li>Player Movement</li>
    <li>Level exit / Checkpoint control</li>
    <li>Enemy hp, speed, range, etc.</li>
    <br />
  - Communication with artists and game designers -<br /><br />
  As a small Team of seven people, everyone was involved with Game design.<br />
  Some initial ideas, the chains and some level design guidelines,<br />
  as well as the documentation of these concepts were part of my work.<br />
  Game design however was not my main responsibility.<br /><br />
  Explaining tools, communicate about file formats, implementation of assets and solving other problems was daily business.<br /><br />
  - Administrative work -<br /><br />
  Managing version control (back then - Mercurial using TortoiseHG), maintaining website and itch,<br />
  Google Drive and other software related things, prepared the build for presentations.<br />
  Besides managing (and learning) version control, this wasn't much workload though, as my team did a good job.
